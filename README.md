THE TREE
Posted on 17 Dec 2019 by Michael Allen Hone
Put lights on a fake or dying tree. Hang balls on it and then plug it in until it births presents. We all see it for what it is. Idolatry. Is everyone that afraid. After reading the entire history of the origins of Christmas and the tree along with easter and eggs/bunnies. Does nobody even care about how much of an offense that seems to be?

God is a jealous God . Scripture says his very name is jealous. How then is worshipping crosses and saints even remotely OK. How is the time period from December 5 through May 1 not seen as completely offensive and reprehensible to God and his people. The pagan blood sacrifices, seasonal chants or spellcasting which we call Christmas carols. Stockings hung and filled with mostly sugar and useless items to create more feet for Satan to walk in much like the members of the body of Christ. We decorate everything with Baal’s and the poisonous plants and non edible berries. Mistletoe figuratively sending us into a down ward spiral. Then the Baal drop on New years, and yet nobody still has a problem after reading Nebuchadnezzar? Yet and then the 3-4 busiest months in health and fitness full of Vanity, regret, guilt, and vanity again. All of this right before the switch to palm Sunday and ash Wednesday and the death and resurrection. Seems like we’ve all been duped. Those who know the truth doing little or nothing to change it I guess . Me not even being able to convince my own household the need for change and the redirection of our emotional and spiritual energy is vital and necessary shows why. They just want it the way its always been and fuck the consequences. I’m so tired of even my coworkers when I mentioned what there actually setting there kids up for, they seem so OK with it and like its even cooler now that they have some evil explanation. Children have been being sacrificed not physically but in every other way to this season and these ritualistic practices. No wonder Jesus was crucified. Quit sacrificing to the tree, the asherahs, the Baal’s, and to Satan. If anyone knows where a house of God is that doesn’t practice these things let me know

RECONCEPTION
Posted on 30 Oct 2020 by Michael Allen Hone
There are a lot of powers and people out there in this world that would like to take from us that which makes us who we are. They would like to take our will and our lives and bend them to their own motives and make us essentially into slaves mind controlled automotans. For some of us these people an entity’s have taken and controlled much of what we do. For some of us we have spent years or lifetimes in relationships because we were controlled and/or coerced, our very beliefs we’re taken hostage if not our personal being. It is my desire to set people free from this. Uninformed consent in legal world is as good as no consent at all. It may have the initial appearance of consent and even comfortability . However the individual loses more than just their right to choose the roll that they want to play or live out and the fantasy they wish to exist Within. Informed means first not having been prepped or otherwise prepared to follow a path coerced buy predisposition of somebody else and not of my own intent or desire. Those who truly choose the roll and path that they are comfortable with and/or love, cherish, desire to be within and desire to share with others is something that only those who have been given this option can truly explain, and those that have lost this option or never had it can truly understand. That which people take and seek to possess in you and seek to strip from you or to tarnish, or disgrace, it is these things, this essence of Who You Are that I will never take from you. It is my goal and need rather that you would desire to give me wholeheartedly this essence this will and insight without holding back. I “do will” these intangible and priceless assets to be given or shared in complete trust and find a New Freedom in this bond. I truly believe this is why they say that God is a gentleman and that he doesn’t force himself upon those that he wishes to love him. If I take it or manipulate and coerced his from you and change it into something other then what you desire, I have destroyed that which makes you special and damage your ability to be free within that realm. I even see the other side where one can only overcome limitations and find new pleasures and become fit for new roles through some the above-mentioned methods. However this should be done carefully and through example not subjugation and torture. Torture not that approved by the one playing the role of the masochist what is a sub slave but more the mental torture of emotional blackmail and lifelong enslavement how’s the other consciousness. If you bestowed this upon me, your will, your essence, fantasy and inhibition lt would never be violated. I would only ask that it be given to me full heartedly and decide that you would like to trust “Me” with the deepest and most intimate things about you then both you and I will surely know what true intimacy really is. We all have a role or roles that were comfortable living and playing, that we thrive in. These at their core already streaching your limitations. These parts of our being were meant to be a part of and to Encompass us. Whether that role be possessive and yes controlling only to the point for which the partner or partners are comfortable with and have agreed to willingly when they are giving themselves completely to “Me”. By the same token there is a sub slave who gives himself completely as subservient and willingly as an extension of the Fulfillment of the others desires and Fantasies gaining their happiness and pleasure in and through the extremes and unpredictability of their partner. That this is only achieved if this part of them, this role was assumed willingly without manipulation, without mind control, and without coercion or violence. Just as there is one that loves the nurturing spirit, Tender Touch and the gentle voice of the lovers hand. There are those that loves the abuse and semi violence and rough nature of the Dom or master. it is only in the giving over of this will knowingly fully informed do we find Freedom to truly fulfill our role(s) that brings us pleasure and fulfillment unlike anything you have known. It is this that I want, it is this that I want to give. Esotericdom….

“GOD WITH US”

#(Fortunately all things are possible with the power God granted me to create and overcome. Uploading my daily patch Fix. The ability to interface with the software is dependent on a few repeating matters of discipline and provides me with the ability to take positive and influential thought and action. “The Word of God” is my starting point. After which I find a place wherein “bridging the gap” I can find inspiration and optimism. This allows me to look forward and project, beauty, love, righteousness, imaginations becoming reality. Still aware of all sides but no longer subject to the negative influence of anything, rather I receive the culmination of light and majesty, hope and joy incepted by the nature of Gods unconditional love for me.)

My problem and solution

limits describing how close we can get point Q to P along the secant line but because a point has no breadth we can do this to the infinitesimal. describing our ability to take obscurity and move it to almost equally distinctiveness or better said out of obscurity to near perfect clarity or almost = the point at the tangent. fortunately with secant being a mathematical inverse of another trigonometric property CSC.  We can make other logical connections.when will we reach a level of logical and technological development that the q is nearly p but never equally creates fatal errors in the system I believe the secant line actually is representative of the focal length at which one’s consciousness needs be in order to fully comprehend another point for which they may not necessarily be tuned for due to abstraction at the incorrect length of understanding.
As q gets close to p of the secant becomes close enough to the slope of the tangent to be almost indistinguishable distinguishable

  Metaphysical  Consequence of a limit not existing what exists in the space between the two points for the limits fall off Into Obscurity

How does the Klein bottle help described asymptotes and the no-limit dilemmas as in they meet no Mutual point that we can understand as of yet
derived vs fractured personalities in children fracturing causes proportional errors, asymptotes, and discontinuity, sometimes to the point of nonfunctionality?
derivations give the support of preceding and the guidance at point A. even as A changes locality memories original representation theorem tracing back to the last memory or concept of an object or idea and then traced back to previous representation temporarily within the mind. to its origin. finding connected info at each point along the way
Everywhere if two functions are continuous everywhere then their composition is continuous everywhere this correlates to if two extensions are continuous everywhere initial starting point is also continuous everywhere Kant focal length to be a constant and a variable in Vector calculus depending on the continuity-discontinuity of a function and can’t we use the same graph for every single equation using focal length to change our proportional values for scalability and perspective change theoretical theoretical proportional change what if we inferred that’s a graph itself what’s the constant and that at some point it would have continuous functions within its domain and sometimes it would have discontinuous functions within its domain. Another scalable object. Possible correlations to focal length reasoning exedra

If something’s almost indistinguishable it is still distinguishable to some degree and if we know it’s level of distinguishability from different and relative perspectives based upon the angle and other mathematical properties we can fill in its almost indistinguishability with either the rest of the abstract or it’s inverse which would be complete distinguishability

People can be the graph and all representations therein are the concepts of every function dealing with every type of number from counting numbers too complex

The graph representing possibly God’s construct giving everything created within the same property but as seeing as possessing different attribute attributable qualities within the construct depending on or point from which one looks at another object and that even the forest for the trees construct as a concept is something created within the three-dimensional space of the graph minus everything that isn’t of that concept object etc which represents a mathematical equation of sorts that can be Quantified by either concept or the whole minus the concept

Even a concept as tension on a string can be seen as a system in which object or multiple objects are connected and being manipulated in a given Direction based upon various variables like that of a hanging weight coefficients of static and kinetic friction and the fulcrum point if a hanging weight exist it’s a system out of balance special dispensation can apply especially being able to read extrapolate this algorithm metaphysically and psychologically

How to realign someone’s beliefs based upon the numbers in their own life in

order for the math to work.

Simplicity is the key teaches people that simplify simplify simplify just as mathematics evolves it becomes more and more simple not more complex. Even and in spite of complex numbers being at the current pinochle of our understanding of mathematics

it appears at first to be more complex so you run the numbers and find out associations and rules which govern all associations and rules.

First five years theory

identifying differences initially provide more information and reference irrespective of vintage about any concept especially mathematics, than do similarities which give us comprehension over time due to other associations a priori or a posteriori

initial consequent??? reverse extrapolating proper righting form from the comprehension of the form of writing as your reading something so formed

Specific vs nonspecific locality direction of thought vs before and after thinking to have 2 points specifying a locality

we can, therefore, imply seeing backward in time as a nonlocality forming thought direction.

    ultimate goal simplifies our understanding (total) through math and logic even further with knowledge of complex numbers being representational as people and their diversities/similarities. Then reverse engineer a language comprised of the individuals own symbols and governed by the person’s magnitude explaining it back to the individual, in essentially their own words and representations forming an almost immediate need to extend this understanding even if it challenges entrenched beliefs; the ultimate mathematical discontinuity
If these beliefs are found to be either detrimental to the whole the individual or any of the constituent parts??

    do we learn more about x if we keep studying 1000th x? Perhaps after 10th x familiarity breeds contempt as in kinesiology.  So introducing Y or A or gamma or sigma etc would be the concepts or variables that would give us drastically improved understanding. This upon entering the 1st Delta. Now constantly change this every time allowing no dependant on familiarity for distinction or renunciation or clarification

memory retrieval reconstruction focusing on overwrite and not insert ATM. overwrite eventually obscures previous information and finally covers it completely so from point a looking in b direction I can no longer see it. Now to retrieve it decompilation of part or all of the overwritten must be done systematically to know now that what your looking at is either all or a part of the previously seen phenomena. the only option I have found for this is retrieving it by association from a vantage point that has no obscurity between its New perspective point P and b.

once uncovered or disassociated it can be essentially reached with a no-overwrite contingency attached by creating additional relevant associations on the surface
